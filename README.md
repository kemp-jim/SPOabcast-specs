This repo contains the mCRL2 specifications and the properties related to my masters thesis called "Formal Modeling and Verification of Speculative Primary-Order Atomic Broadcast".

The specifications and formulas may differ slightly from those presented in the thesis, as certain comments were removed or the layout was changed. However, the specifications themselves are the same.
